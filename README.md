## Getting started
**Download client code on computer**

- First, download this code and open it up in your IDE of choice (We use vscode). Open up a terminal to run commands.

- Pull the repo down onto you local machine (click the code button and you will see many options, like opening with vscode).

## Description

- This project allows you to control a robot with multiple sensors with low latency from anywhere over the internet.

## Bash Scripts

In the root folder, you will see two bash scripts. These are scripts we made to conveniently transfer files from a unix based system to our raspberry pi. trans.sh transfers the file, and t_and_r.sh transfers and then runs the file. You need to change the permissions of script to be able to execute it. If you have a windows, you are mostly out of luck (you could try gitbash for a bash environment, but idk)
